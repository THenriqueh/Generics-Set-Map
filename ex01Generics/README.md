A consulting company wants to evaluate the performance of products,
employees, among other things. One of what she needs is to find
the largest among a set of elements. Make a program that reads a
set of products from a file, as in the example, and then
show the most expensive of them.

Example:

Computer,890.50

IPhone X,910.00

Tablet,550.00

Most expensive:

IPhone, 910.00
